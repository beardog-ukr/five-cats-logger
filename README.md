# five-cats-logger
Logging library for Qt

## Features

*FiveCats* got following:
* five levels of debug messages (or logging can be turned off at all)
* save log messages to file, or to stdout or both
* nicely add class and method name to the messages
* easily process command line options with *QCommandLineParser*

However there is also something NOT implemented here:
* singletone stuff, because singletones are evil
* multithreading. If you have few threads, you should use few *FiveCatsLogger* instances.


## Usage
